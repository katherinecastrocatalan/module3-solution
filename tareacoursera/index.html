             El Pollo Loco is a Mexican roast chicken restaurant franchise with more than four hundred locations in the United States and Mexico.

El Pollo Loco was founded on Monday, January 6, 1975 by Juan Francisco “Pancho” Ochoa in Guasave, Sinaloa, Mexico, it is one of the first Mexican restaurant franchises that successfully crossed the borders of Mexico.

In 1974 Juan Francisco “Pancho” Ochoa decided to commercially exploit a family recipe that had been preserved through several generations. The recipe was a mix of seasonings, herbs, spices, and fruits added to the chicken roasting process. In the beginning Francisco Ochoa sold his chickens on a cart. On Monday, January 6, 1975, the First Pollo Loco was inaugurated in the then small town of Guasave, Sinaloa, which continues to operate to this day and over the years, the franchise has expanded to several cities in Mexico. The first restaurant in the United States opened on December 8, 1980 in Los Angeles, California. The franchises.

The El Pollo Loco chain operates in the southwestern United States, in California. Their main dish is roast chicken. Initially, the competition was with Kentucky Fried Chicken for chicken dishes, but today, El Pollo Loco has expanded to serve dishes that rival Taco Bell. However, their biggest competition are smaller restaurants with similar names.

Something that this restaurant is characterized by is its traditional sauces, which combined with tortilla chips make a typical mixture of the Mexican flavor.

In the United States, the network's most recent marketing efforts, featuring a Latino acting a character named El Caliente, have drawn the ire of some Chicano advocacy groups, who claim that this advertising represents a stereotype of Latinos. However, El Caliente's advertising is considered less offensive than other Latino mascots like Frito Bandito.

In Torreón and Monterrey, the chain has been very successful in its radio marketing. 2 Crazy Chicken maintains classic promotions such as free half chicken on the purchase of a whole chicken during designated Miercolocos during certain times of the year. Actor Brad Pitt, before he became famous, worked for the network using a Chicken Botarga when he was only 17 years old.
